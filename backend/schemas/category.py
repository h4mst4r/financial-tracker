"""Category request/response schemas (ARCH §3.7, Story 3.1).

Generic-entity surface → **snake_case wire** (plain `BaseModel`, no `to_camel`). Unlike the
household/profile surface (the §2.14.C camelCase exception), categories cross the wire snake_case to
match the generic frontend entity layer (`frontend/src/types/entity.ts`; `api/client.ts` does no
case conversion). The list response follows the `{items, total}` rule (backend.md).

Three schemas per the services/base.py template: `CategoryCreate` (required), `CategoryUpdate`
(all optional — partial via `exclude_unset`), `CategoryResponse` (`from_attributes`). `depth` is
derived by the service from `parent_id`, so it is read-only (response only, never in the body).
